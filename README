Little Smalltalk                                                              Version 3
=======================================================================================
This is a somewhat customized version of Little Smalltalk, Version 3. I have organized
the source files, wrote a new, simpler Makefile, and adapted the source for compilation
on modern BSD and Linux systems.

The update process is ongoing. I hope to have it working on Linux, NetBSD, FreeBSD,
and DragonFly BSD in the near future.
