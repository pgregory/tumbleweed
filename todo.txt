Parser:
  * Support for LongInteger in the lexer/parser, automatically creating the
    right type depending on the size of the value specified.

VM:
  * Review the hashing mechanism, it's still caught up a bit in the integer c
    ode.
  * Remove inherent limitations on size.
    * 255 byte allocation chunk limit (memory.c)
  * Check and remove the multiply/divide by two for the object indexing, it 
    was done that way because of the old integer special case code, shouldn't 
    be needed anymore.

CLI:
  * Review use of libedit, could it perhaps be implemented in Smalltalk?
  * Implement <tab> completion from the Smalltalk namespace.

Web Based Interface:
  * List control for Class list.
  * File loading for more complex web pages/templates.

Primitives:
  * File loading from filesystem.
  * System image load from zip.
  * File loading from zip.
