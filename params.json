{"name":"Tumbleweed","google":"UA-34601904-1","tagline":"A Lightweight Smalltalk based development platform.","body":"### Welcome to Tumbleweed.\r\nA lightweight, image based, encapsulated development environment based around Smalltalk, specifically, \"A Little Smalltalk\" version 3.0 by Timothy A. Budd.\r\n\r\n## Project Goals\r\n* Live coding of interactive multi-media applications.\r\n* Cross platform application delivery.\r\n* Dynamically extensible.\r\n* All the benefits of the Smalltalk language and framework.\r\n\r\n## Status\r\nTumbleweed began life as the little Smalltalk system (version 3.0) from Timothy A. Budd. Since then it has been steadily updated to modernise various features moving towards the goals listed above. \r\n* Implement a completely new, mark and sweep garbage collected, memory management framework.\r\n* Extend the class system to support full meta class specification, as per Smalltalk-80.\r\n* Add a flexible FFI framework for accessing native code in shared libraries.\r\n* Add exception support, implemented completely in Smalltalk.\r\n\r\n## Roadmap\r\nOnce the core functionality is ready, the system will be extended with new libraries and modules, Smalltalk and native, to provide the necessary functionality to author multi-media content.\r\n* SFML/OpenGL/DirectX\r\n* Component framework\r\n* Animation system\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nTumbleweed was originally based on version 3 of Timothy A. Budd's \"A Little Smalltalk\", refactored and updated by @pgregory. It still retains some elements of the original code base, but as time progresses the influence of LST on Tumbleweed becomes less and less. The intention is to refactor as much of the code as possible, replacing it with a more modern C++ based architecture.\r\n\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
