Budd.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nTumbleweed was originally based on version 3 of Timothy A. Budd's \"A Little Smalltalk\", refactored and updated by @pgregory. It still retains some elements of the original code base, but as time progresses the influence of LST on Tumbleweed becomes less and less. The intention is to refactor as much of the code as possible, replacing it with a more modern C++ based architecture.\r\n\r\n","tagline":"A Lightweight Smalltalk based development platform.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
